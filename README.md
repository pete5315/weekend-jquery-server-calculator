# Project Name

Server side calculator (weekend assignment)

## Description

This is a calculator that works out the arithmetic on the server side. I approached it using the event -> post -> state -> get -> render flow we've been practicing in class. I made separate modules for storing the prior calculations and doing the calculation but the rest is in the server.

## Prerequisites
Node
Body Parser
Express

## Installation
-If you want to run the simple version of the calculator, check out the main branch in git. If you want to run the more buttons-y version of it, check out the stretch-goals branch in git.
-Run "npm start" in your terminal
-Open http://localhost:5000/

## Usage
It's a very simple calculator! Have fun! There are some rails so you can't do anything TOO wild.
