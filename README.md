Server side calculator (weekend assignment)

## Description

This is a calculator that works out the arithmetic on the server side. I approached it using the event -> post -> state -> get -> render flow we've been practicing in class. I made separate modules for storing the prior calculations and doing the calucation but the rest is in the server.
